UART Transmitter algorithm:
1. (State: IDLE) Wait until rising_edge of tx_start -- once that happens d_in data goes into our Parallel In Serial Out shift register, and we go into State 1
2. (State: State1) Transmitting state:
	a) Start bit: Lower rx bit
	b) Wait 104166.6666667 ns
	for i in [0..7]:
		c) Send bit{i}
		d) Wait -||- ns
		
	e) Stop bit: Put high rx
3. Send tx_done impulse, go back into IDLE state
